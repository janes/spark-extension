 * Configuration class for diffing Datasets.

 * @param rightColumnPrefix prefix of columns from the right Dataset
 * @param insertDiffValue value in diff column for inserted rows
 * @param changeDiffValue value in diff column for changed rows
 * @param deleteDiffValue value in diff column for deleted rows
 * @param nochangeDiffValue value in diff column for un-changed rows
 * @param nullOutValidData if true, all cells which are equal (or in a given tolerance range) are replaced with null to increase visibility of erroneous data
 * @param ignoreColumns an optional list of columns which are dropped from both sides before comparing
 * @param datatypeComparators an optional map of datatypes with the applicable comparator, overwriting the default '<=>' comparator
 * @param columnComparators an optional map of column names with the applicable comparator, overwriting the datatype comparators
 * @param joinType  Type of the join to perform. Default `full_outer`, should usually not be changed.
 *                  Only in some cases advisable, such as for testing purposes to avoid OOM exceptions or to zero in on a specific section of the diff.
 *                  Must be one of: `inner`, `cross`, `outer`, `full`, `full_outer`, `left`, `left_outer`, `right`, `right_outer`, `left_semi`, `left_anti`.
